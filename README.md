# 🧠 LeetCode Practice – Ananya Nivarthi

Hey there! 👋  
This repository is where I regularly practice and document my LeetCode journey. Each problem has its own folder and contains:
I'm keeping things organized so I can track my progress, revisit tricky problems, and share my solutions with others who might find them helpful.



## 🗂️ Folder Structure

```
ananyanivarthi-leetcode/
├── [problem-number]-[problem-title]/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── [solution-file].py
```


## 🚦 How to Explore

1. Pick any folder by problem number or title.
2. Check out the `README.md` for context or notes.
3. Dive into the Python solution for the logic.

I highly encourage trying the problems yourself before peeking at the code. But if you're stuck, feel free to use my approach as a reference!



## 🔁 Updates

This repo will keep growing as I solve more problems and improve older solutions. Stay tuned for cleaner, optimized versions!



Happy Leetcoding! 🧩✨
